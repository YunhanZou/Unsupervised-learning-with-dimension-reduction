# Unsupervised-learning-with-dimension-reduction

## Overview

This project explores the properties of two unsupervised learning algorithms: K-means and EM clustering, and four dimensionality 
reduction algorithms: PCA, ICA, random projection, and univariate selection.

The two data sets used in this project are:
- [Phishing website data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/phishing+websites)
- [Banking data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)

## Running code

- This project will be run using Jupyter Notebook, so make sure you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) installed.
- Before running, make sure you have all the dependencies installed: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, itertools, timeit.
- Download the files to a directory of your choice. Remember to change the IO path of parsing data.
- Run the Jupyter Notebook by `jupyter notebook`. The project will load and run.
- You can run each cell sequentially to see the output for each task, or you can run all cells from beginning. All related data and plots
will show under each cell.
